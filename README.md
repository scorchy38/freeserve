Assignment: Please design an Online Reservation App. So the Online Reservation App needs to have a login screen, a sign up/registration screen. 
Login Page is where the Person A of the Business can login and moves to the Home Page.
Once Person A can see the Home Screen, There are a few options for the Person A,
1. Create New Reservation,If he clicks on Create New Reservation, he moves to the next Screen where he will be able to enter username, mobile number, email id, date of birth and a save button. Once the save button is clicked, all the data mentioned above will get stored in firebase/mongodb or sql (According to your choice)
2. Read Reservation Screen: Screen where the user is able to access all the reservations created till today.
3. Edit/Update Reservation Screen: Screen where the user is able to make changes to a reservation made.
